1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,748
本节我想为大家展示在实际中RSA是如何使用的
In this segment I wanna show you how RSA
is used in practice and in particular, I

2
00:00:04,748 --> 00:00:09,497
特别地，我想告诉大家一个标准，叫做公钥密码学一号标准
wanna tell you about a standard called a
Public Key Cryptography standard number

3
00:00:09,497 --> 00:00:14,734
RKCS1。那么我已经几次告诉大家，永远不要使用
one PKCS one. So I've already told you a
couple of times that you should never use

4
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:19,262
所谓的教科书RSA。大家永远不应该直接使用RSA
what's called textbook RSA. You should
never directly encrypt the message using

5
00:00:19,262 --> 00:00:23,962
因为这是不安全的。大家在应用RSA函数前
RSA because that's insecure. You always
have to do something to the message before

6
00:00:23,962 --> 00:00:28,318
必须始终对明文做些处理。我们上节看过了ISO的标准
you actually apply the RSA function. We
saw the ISO standard in the previous

7
00:00:28,318 --> 00:00:32,846
我们生成了一个随机x，用RSA加密x
segment where what we did is we generated
a random x, encrypted x using RSA, and

8
00:00:32,846 --> 00:00:37,375
然后从这个x，我们推出一个对称加密密钥。不过
then from this x we derived a symmetric
encryption key. But that's actually not how

9
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:41,677
这还不是RSA在实际中的应用。在实际中，事情不太一样
RSA is used in practice. In practice
things worked a little differently and

10
00:00:41,677 --> 00:00:46,150
实际中，系统生成一个对称加密密钥
typically what happens is the system
generates a symmetric encryption key and

11
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:50,508
然后让RSA去加密这个给定的对称加密密钥
then RSA is asked to encrypt the given
symmetric encryption key rather than

12
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:55,275
而不是生成对称密钥，作为RSA加密的一部分。那么在实际中
generating the symmetric key as part of
RSA encryption. So in practice as I

13
00:00:55,275 --> 00:01:00,908
如我所说，RSA系统有一个输入的对称密钥需要加密
say, what happens the RSA system is given
this input a symmetric encryption key to

14
00:01:00,908 --> 00:01:06,408
例如，这个可能是一个AES密钥，128位
encrypt for example this could be a, an AES
key that would be like 128 bits and then

15
00:01:06,408 --> 00:01:12,040
然后这个密钥被加密，首先我们取这128位
the way this key is actually encrypted is
first we take these 128 bits and we expand

16
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,077
我们把它们扩展成整个模的大小。例如，这个模是2048位
them into the full modulo size. For
example, this would be 2048 bits, and then

17
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:21,678
然后我们应用RSA函数。那么问题是，这是怎样预处理的？
we apply the RSA function. And so the
question is, how should this preprocessing

18
00:01:21,678 --> 00:01:26,132
我们应该如何把给我们的128位AES密钥扩展成2048位
be done? How should we expand the 128 bit
AES key that was given to us into a 2048

19
00:01:26,132 --> 00:01:30,531
然后再应用RSA呢？进一步的问题是
bit value that can then be applied with
RSA? And then furthermore the question is,

20
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:35,150
我们如何论证得到的系统是安全的呢？
how do we argue that the resulting system
is secure? So in all the way of doing it

21
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:40,082
在实际中这是广泛应用的，即所谓的PKCS1 1.5
which is actually very widely deployed in
practice is what's called PKCS1 version

22
00:01:40,082 --> 00:01:44,491
公钥密码学标准，也就是PKCS的意思
1.5, Public Key Cryptography Standard,
that's what PKCS stands for. So I wanna

23
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:49,307
那么我想给大家展示这个机制是如何工作的，
特别地，我会给大家看所谓的
show you how this mechanism works and in
particular, I'll show you what's called

24
00:01:49,307 --> 00:01:53,775
PKCS1模式2。模式2表示加密，模式1表示签名
PKCS1 Mode 2. Mode 2 denotes
encryption, mode 1 denotes signatures so

25
00:01:53,775 --> 00:01:58,126
那么这里我们只看加密。PKCS1工作的过程如下
here we're gonna just focus on the
encryption. So the way PKCS1 works is

26
00:01:58,126 --> 00:02:02,710
你取你的明文，比如说这里是128位AES密钥
as follows, you take your message, this
would be the 128 bit AES key for example,

27
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:07,392
把它放在你要产生的值的最低128位
and you put it as the least significant bits
of the value that you're creating. The

28
00:02:07,392 --> 00:02:12,641
接下来你在它后面附上16个1，即十六进制的FF
next thing you do is you append sixteen
bits of one to it, you know FF.

29
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:18,009
这是16个1。然后接下来把它附在这个随机密码本的后面
This is sixteen bits of one. And then the
next you do is you append the random pad

30
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:23,104
这个密码本中任何地方都不含FF
that actually does not contain FF
anywhere inside the random pad. So this

31
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:28,072
这个密码本类似于1900位随机数
is basically something like on the order
of what is it, 1900 random bits except

32
00:02:28,072 --> 00:02:33,356
但这个随机数里面不含FF。最后在结果的最高位
that there are on FF's inside those random
bits and finally at the very top, you put

33
00:02:33,356 --> 00:02:38,513
放上数02。这意味着这个明文已经被PKCS1模式2编码了
the number 02. This indicates that this
plain text has been encoded using PKCS1

34
00:02:38,513 --> 00:02:43,476
那么这整个值，我们刚刚创建的整个值
mode 2. And then this whole value here,
this whole thing that we just created.

35
00:02:43,476 --> 00:02:48,893
这就是一个2048位的字符串，作为RSA函数的输入
This is just 2048 bit string is the thing
that gets fed into the RSA function and is

36
00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:54,118
去计算它的e次方模N，得到的就是PKCS1的密文
raised to the power of e modulo N. And the
resulting thing is PKCS1 ciphertext. Now

37
00:02:54,118 --> 00:02:59,471
现在当然，解密者要求RSA函数的逆，还原这个分组
the decrypter of course is going to invert
the RSA function, He's gonna get back this

38
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:03,267
他会看最高位
block, He's gonna look at the most
significant bits and he's gonna say

39
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,885
发现是02，意味着这是PKCS1格式的
there's a 02 in there that means that this
PKCS one formatted. Since it's PKCS one

40
00:03:07,885 --> 00:03:12,123
它会移除这些02，它会移除所有的这些随机密码本
formatted, it's gonna remove those 02.
It's gonna remove all the random pad up

41
00:03:12,123 --> 00:03:16,810
直到遇见FF，然后剩下的就是最初明文
until the FF. And then anything
that stays beyond that is the original

42
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:22,180
然后用这个明文来解密密文的内容
message which is then used you know to say
decrypt the actual body of the ciphertext.

43
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:28,206
如我所说，这个机制应用极广，例如
And as I said, this mechanism is extremely
widely deployed, For example, it's used in

44
00:03:28,206 --> 00:03:33,088
HTTPS中就有用。现在有趣的是，这个PKCS1 1.5
是在上世纪80年代设计的
HTTPS. Now interestingly, this PKCS1
version 1.5 was designed in the late 80's.

45
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:37,861
当时还没有安全性证明可以论证这个机制事实上是安全的
There was really no security proof to
argue that this mechanism is in fact

46
00:03:37,861 --> 00:03:42,952
事实上，这是一种很普遍的现象：在没有安全性证明的情况下
secure. And as it turns out, it is very
common when there is no security proof, it

47
00:03:42,952 --> 00:03:48,234
实际上系统会被破解，这里有一个非常优雅的攻击
turns out that actually things break and
there's a very, very elegant attack due to

48
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:53,071
由Bleichenbacher在1998年提出，
Daniel Bleichenbacher展示了如何攻击
Bleichenbacher back in 1998, Daniel
Bleichenbacher which shows how to attack

49
00:03:53,071 --> 00:03:58,290
PKCS1，当他被使用在HTTPS中时。那么我们看
这个攻击是怎样工作的
PKCS1 when it's used for example inside of
HTTPS. So let's see how the attack works.

50
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:03,228
其想法是，假设攻击者截获了一个特定密文
So the idea is this, supposed the attacker
intercepted a certain ciphertext so this

51
00:04:03,228 --> 00:04:07,988
那么这是PKCS1密文，那么要点是，它是用PKCS1编码的
is PKCS1 ciphertext so the point is
it's encoded using PKCS1 and then the

52
00:04:07,988 --> 00:04:12,812
然后结果作为RSA函数的输入。我们把这个密文叫做
result is fed into the RSA function. And
we call the ciphertext the output of the

53
00:04:12,812 --> 00:04:16,797
RSA函数的输出。攻击者想解密密文
RSA function. The attacker wants to
basically decrypt the ciphertext, So let

54
00:04:16,797 --> 00:04:21,065
让我给大家抽象地展示攻击者会怎么做。我们先简化SSL
me show you abstractly what the attacker
is gonna do. We're gonna just simplify SSL

55
00:04:21,065 --> 00:04:25,349
比如说攻击者可以直接发送密文给网页服务器
and just say that the attacker can
basically send the ciphertext directly to

56
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:29,421
服务器将试图使用它的私钥去解密密文
the web server. The web server is gonna
try and decrypt the ciphertext using its

57
00:04:29,421 --> 00:04:33,441
它怎么办呢？在解密之后，首先
secret key. And then what is it gonna do?
Well, the first thing it does after the

58
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:37,208
它问：密文的解密结果是否是PKCS1编码的？
decryption, well, it's gonna ask: is the
decryption of the ciphertext PKCS1

59
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:41,229
换句话说，它会看最高几位并问
encoded? In other words, it's gonna look
at the most significant bits and ask: is

60
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:45,250
最高两位是02吗？如果是，才继续正常的解密
this 02 in the most significant positions? If
they are, it's gonna continue properly

61
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,322
然后继续执行协议；如果这些最高位不是02
decrypting and then continue with the
protocol and if there is no 02 in those

62
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:53,292
就会声明一个错误。那么如果明文最高位是02
positions, it's gonna announce an error.
So if the most significant bits of the

63
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:57,558
就会如期执行协议
plaintext are 02, it's gonna continue
with the protocol as expected, if the most

64
00:04:57,558 --> 00:05:01,951
如果最高位不是02，就会返回一个错误
significant bits are not 02 is gonna send
back an error message and tell the

65
00:05:01,951 --> 00:05:06,059
告诉攻击者，你发送了一条无效的密文。
现在令人惊奇的是
attacker, hey, you sent in invalid
ciphertext. Now the amazing thing is that,

66
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:10,276
这一点让攻击者得以测试出，给定密文的最高16位
this lets the attacker test whether the
sixteen most significant bits of the

67
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:14,712
是否为02。换句话说，攻击者可以提交
decryption of the given ciphertext are 02
or not. In other words, the attacker can

68
00:05:14,712 --> 00:05:19,635
他想提交给网页服务器的任何密文，网页服务器
submit whatever ciphertext he wants to the
web server. The web server will invert the

69
00:05:19,635 --> 00:05:24,772
都会求RSA函数的逆，然后告诉攻击者逆的结果是否以02开头
RSA function and then tell the attacker
whether the inversion started with 02 or

70
00:05:24,772 --> 00:05:30,210
那么某种意义上，这就给了攻击者一个神谕，使得他可以测试
not. So in some sense gives the attacker an
oracle that lets him test whether the

71
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:35,407
任意密文的逆是否以02开头。实际上
inversion of any ciphertext begins with 02
or not. And it turns out that's actually

72
00:05:35,407 --> 00:05:39,916
这足以完全解密攻击者想解密的任何密文
enough to completely decrypt any
ciphertext the attacker wants, Just add

73
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:44,800
一点点的信息泄漏，因为RSA的特性
little bit of information leakage just by
properties of RSA let the attacker

74
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,860
让攻击者完全解密一个给定密文。那么攻击者会这么干
completely decrypt a given ciphertext.
Also here's what the attacker is gonna do,

75
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,052
他有一个他想解密的密文
well, he has a ciphertext that he wants to
decrypt so what he'll do is he'll take a

76
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:57,940
当然他把密文直接交给网页服务器
cyphertext and of course feed that
directly into the web server and ask does

77
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,929
询问它是否以02开头。接下来
it begin with the 02 or not. The next
thing he's gonna do is he's gonna choose a

78
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:06,480
攻击者选择一个随机值r，他要构建一个新密文c'
random value r and he's gonna build a new
ciphertext c prime. Which is (r to the e)

79
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:12,013
也就是(r^e)c mod N。这会造成什么？
如果我们把r带入RSA函数
c modulo N. Now what does that do? If we
pull the r into the RSA function, really

80
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:17,546
我们只是与RSA明文相乘，PKCS1封装的明文m
what we just did is we multiply the RSA
plaintext, you know the PKCS1 including

81
00:06:17,546 --> 00:06:23,289
我们用r去乘它，计算整项的e次方
in m, we multiply that by r and that,
that whole thing gets raised to the power

82
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:27,897
好，那么这就是c乘(r^e)的效果
of e. Okay. So that's the effect of
multiplying c by (r to the e). It multiplies

83
00:06:27,897 --> 00:06:32,334
它把r与明文相乘，r是攻击者控制的值
the plaintext by r, a value that the
attacker controls. And then he's gonna

84
00:06:32,334 --> 00:06:37,371
然后攻击者会把c'发送给网页服务器，服务器的回答是肯定的
send c prime to the web server and the web
server is gonna say yes, this starts with

85
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:42,132
以02开头，或是否定的，不以02开头。那么现在
我们可以把这个问题进行抽象
02 or no, this doesn't start with 02. So
now we can abstract this problem to

86
00:06:42,132 --> 00:06:47,805
推广到更一般的情况，大家可以考虑如下情形
something more general which you can think
of as the following so I have this number

87
00:06:47,805 --> 00:06:53,010
我知道这个数x，这个数是我想获得的PKCS1对m的编码
x in my head. This is the number I'm
trying to get The PKCS1 encoding on m. I'm

88
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:58,483
我考虑这个数x，然后我让你选择r
thinking of this number x and then what I
let you do is for r, which way r of your

89
00:06:58,483 --> 00:07:04,088
我会告诉你r*x mod n是否以02开头
choice I will tell you whether r times x mod n
starts with 02 or not. And it turns out by

90
00:07:04,088 --> 00:07:09,294
实际上通过询问足够多的这样的问题，比如问数百万次
asking enough questions it turns out
either by million questions of this type,

91
00:07:09,294 --> 00:07:14,962
你就可以还原x的全部了。只通过学习r*x是否以02开头
you can basically recover all of x. Just
by learning whether r times x begins with 02

92
00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:20,533
只通过问足够多这样的问题，实际上你可以还原x
or not by asking enough questions, you can
actually recover x. So in reality what

93
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:24,634
实际上这意味着攻击者可以抓取一个给定的密文
this means is that the attacker can
capture a given ciphertext. This maybe

94
00:07:24,634 --> 00:07:28,847
这个可能对应一个密文，比如用户输入的信用卡号
corresponds to a ciphertext where the user
enters the credit card number or a

95
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:33,226
或密码，现在攻击者想解密密文
password, and now the attacker wants to
decrypt the ciphertext. What he would do

96
00:07:33,226 --> 00:07:37,272
他会发送一百万条像这样的密文
is he would send about a million
ciphertext like this, the web server for

97
00:07:37,272 --> 00:07:41,928
对每条这样的密文，网页服务器会回复这个明文是否以02开头
each ciphertext is gonna respond whether
the plaintext begins with 02 or not and at

98
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:46,473
在攻击的最后，攻击者给出密文c的解密结果
the end of the attack, the attacker just
blocks away with the, decryption of the

99
00:07:46,473 --> 00:07:50,727
这对大家来说可能有点神奇
ciphertext c. So this might seem a
little magical to you, how are you able to

100
00:07:50,727 --> 00:07:54,896
怎么能够只通过学习明文的最高位是否是02
just from learning whether the most
significant bits are 02 or not, how you're

101
00:07:54,896 --> 00:07:59,439
就能还原整个明文呢？那么我来给大家一个简单的例子
able to recover the entire plain text. So
let me show you a simple example of this.

102
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,822
我叫这个例子为幼儿Bleichenbacher，只求表达
I'll call those baby Bleichenbacher just
to kinda get the idea across on how this

103
00:08:03,822 --> 00:08:08,098
这个攻击的基本想法。那么设想攻击者可以发送密文c
attack might work. So imagine that the
attacker is able to send the ciphertext c,

104
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:12,641
网页服务器会用私钥解密，不过我们假设
the web server is gonna use the secret key
to decrypt but let's suppose that instead

105
00:08:12,641 --> 00:08:16,596
服务器不检查开头是否是02，而是看最高位
of checking for 02 or not, all the web
server does is he asked is the most

106
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:21,036
是否为1。如果最高位是1，网页服务器会说：是
significant bit one or not. If the most
significant bit is one, the web server

107
00:08:21,036 --> 00:08:25,710
如果最高位不是1，网页服务器会返回"不"
says yes. If the most significant bit is
not one, the web server is no. Moreover,

108
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:30,565
为求进一步简化，我们假设RSA的模N是2的某次幂
to simplify things, let's assume that the
RSA module is n is a power of two. So n =

109
00:08:30,565 --> 00:08:35,539
即N=2^n。当然，这不是一个有效的RSA模
two^n. Of course, this is not a valid RSA
modulus. An RSA modulus used to be a

110
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:40,453
RSA模是一个两指数的乘积。但为求简便
product of two distinct primes. But again,
just to keep things simple, let's pretend

111
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:45,367
我们假定N是2的幂。那么现在大家发现
for a second that n is actually a power of
two. So now you realize that by sending

112
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:49,802
通过给网页服务器发送密文c，攻击者只是
the ciphertext c over to the web server,
the adversary just learn the most

113
00:08:49,802 --> 00:08:54,551
学习明文x的最高位。服务器的行为
significant bits of the plaintext x.
Basically, the server's behavior completely

114
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:59,240
完全泄漏了最高位是什么。现在攻击者可以
reveals what the most significant is. Now
what the attacker can do is he can

115
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:04,175
把密文乘以2^e。现在乘以2^e
multiply the ciphertext by two to the e.
Now multiplying by two to the e has the

116
00:09:04,175 --> 00:09:09,274
就有去乘明文x的效果，就是把x乘以2
effect of multiplying the plaintext x. By
two simply multiplying x by two and

117
00:09:09,274 --> 00:09:15,067
因为我们是工作在2的n次方模下，乘以2就意味着左移
because we're working mod two to the N,
multiplying by two basically means shift

118
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:20,789
好。那么现在当我们左移时，事实上我们学到了
left, okay. So now when we shift left in
fact we get to learn the most significant

119
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:26,581
2x的最高位，也就等于学到了x的次高位，好的
bits of 2x which is really the second most
significant bit of x, okay. So, again the

120
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:32,257
2x的最高位，我们左移了x，并取模N
most significant bit of 2x basically we
shift x to the left. And we reduce modulo

121
00:09:32,257 --> 00:09:37,596
那么现在，2x mod N的最高位
n. So now, the most significant bit of 2x
modulo n is basically the second most

122
00:09:37,596 --> 00:09:42,846
也就是x的次高位。那么我们就学到了x的另一位内容
significant bit of x. So now we learned
another bit of x. And now we're gonna

123
00:09:42,846 --> 00:09:48,158
现在我们重复这步，询问c=4^e
repeat this again. We're gonna query a
four to the e c, That corresponds to

124
00:09:48,158 --> 00:09:54,108
这对应于4x的e次方。询问4x会得到
querying of 4x to the power e. Querying of
4x basically reveals the most significant

125
00:09:54,108 --> 00:09:59,454
4x mod N的最高位。4对应着左移两位
bit of 4x mod n. 4x four corresponds the
shifting by two bits. Which mean now we

126
00:09:59,454 --> 00:10:03,641
意味着现在我们学到了x的第三高位。当我们一次次重复这些
get to learn the third most significant
bit of x. And when we repeat this again,

127
00:10:03,641 --> 00:10:08,041
对于不同的c的倍数，大家可以看出
and again, and again for different multiples
of c and you can see that after just a

128
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:11,751
经过一些询问，大约1000到2000次询问，我们就还原了x
few queries, about a 1,000 or 2,000
queries, we'll recover all of x. The

129
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:15,674
Bleichenbacher需要一百万次的原因在于
reason Bleichenbacher needed about a
million queries is because he wasn't

130
00:10:15,674 --> 00:10:20,020
他不是测试一位，他是在测试最高两位是否为02
testing for one, He was actually testing
for 02 or not 02 and that basically means

131
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,208
这意味着他需要上百万次询问，而不是2000次
that he needs instead of 2,000 queries he
needs actually a million queries but

132
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:28,729
但那足以还原所有的明文了
that's still enough to recover all of the
plaintext text. Okay? So I hope this

133
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:34,337
那么我希望这解释了为什么这个攻击是可能的。
为什么关于RSA逆的最高位的一点点信息
explains why this attack is possible. Why
just this little bit of information about

134
00:10:34,337 --> 00:10:39,359
就足以完全解密RSA了
the most significant bits of the RSA
inverse is enough to completely decrypt

135
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:46,023
至少可以说，PKCS1在网页服务器上曾如上述所实现
RSA. So the bottom line here is that PKCS1 as implemented in web server as up

136
00:10:46,023 --> 00:10:50,323
直到这种攻击被发现，它变得不安全了
until this attack was discovered was
basically insecure because the attacker

137
00:10:50,323 --> 00:10:54,902
因为攻击者可以解密他想要的密文，
通过向网页服务器提交足够都的询问即可
could essentially decrypt a ciphertext he
wants just by issuing enough queries to

138
00:10:54,902 --> 00:11:00,215
那么我们如何抵抗这一攻击呢？
the web server. So how do we defend
against this attack? Well, so the SSL

139
00:11:00,215 --> 00:11:05,004
SSL社区想通过对代码的最小改动
community basically wanted the minimum
change in their code that would prevent

140
00:11:05,004 --> 00:11:09,854
就可以阻止这种攻击。如果大家看RFC，
他们提出的方案如下
this attack from working and so if you
look at the RFC, what they propose is the

141
00:11:09,854 --> 00:11:14,704
这里有很多内容，但他们提出的大致上是说
following. Well, there's a lot of text
here but basically what they propose is to

142
00:11:14,704 --> 00:11:19,433
如果在你应用RSA解密之后，你会获得一个明文
say that if after you apply the RSA
decryption, you get a plaintext that's not

143
00:11:19,433 --> 00:11:24,344
它并不是PKCS1编码的。换句话说，它不是以02开头的
PKCS1 encoded. In other words it doesn't
start with 02. What you're supposed to do

144
00:11:24,344 --> 00:11:28,949
你可以选取某个随机字符串r。只假定
is basically choose some random string r.
And just pretend that the plaintext is

145
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:33,078
明文是一个随机字符串r，只当什么也没发生
just a random string r and continuous as
nothing happened and of course the

146
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:38,438
当然稍后协议会失败。具体地说，如果PKCS1编码不正确
protocol will fail later on. So to be
concrete you see if the PKCS one encoding

147
00:11:38,438 --> 00:11:42,526
你会说预备主密钥
is not correct, what you would do is you
would just say the premaster secret is

148
00:11:42,526 --> 00:11:46,873
是这个随机字符串，或只是随机接收的，我们继续协议
this random string or that we just picked
up off thin air and let's continue the

149
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:50,961
当然建立会话会失败，因为客户端和服务端
protocol and of course the session set up
will fail because the client and the

150
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:55,152
最终达成的交换密钥不一致，这会导致会话终止
server will end up agreeing on different
keys and that will cause the session to

151
00:11:55,152 --> 00:11:59,447
我们实际上不告诉攻击者明文是否以02开头
terminate. So we actually don't tell the
attacker whether the plaintext begins with

152
00:11:59,447 --> 00:12:05,479
我们只是假定明文是某个随机值
02 or not. All we do is just pretend that
the plaintext is some random value. So

153
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:10,096
那么对于许多网页服务器来说，这只是一点点的代码改动
this was a minor code change to many web
servers and it was fairly easy to get

154
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:14,892
是容易布置的，事实上时至今日，大多数的网页服务器
deployed and in fact most web servers out
there today implement this version of

155
00:12:14,892 --> 00:12:19,329
已经实现了这一版本的PKCS1。但是这带来了问题
PKCS1. However, this kind of raises the
question of whether PKCS1 should be

156
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:23,946
PKCS1是否应该都被改变，使得我们得以证明选择密文安全性
changed all together so that we actually
are able to prove chosen ciphertext

157
00:12:23,946 --> 00:12:28,322
这让我们以一种不同的方法来进行使用RSA的加密
security. And that brings us to a
different way of doing encryption using

158
00:12:28,322 --> 00:12:33,391
即所谓的优化非对称加密补齐OAEP
RSA which is called Optimal Asymmetric
Encryption Padding, OAEP. And in fact the

159
00:12:33,391 --> 00:12:40,092
事实上这个PKCS标准被更新了，而PKCS版本2实际上支持OAEP
PKCS standard was updated and PKCS1 version
2.0 actually has support for OAEP which is

160
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:48,871
而OAEP是更好的使用RSA加密的方法。
那么让我解释下OAEP是如何工作的
a better way of doing RSA encryption. So
let me explain how OAEP works. So OAEP is

161
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:54,911
那么OAEP是由Bellare和Rogaway于1994年提出的。OAEP如下工作
due to the Bellare and Rogaway back in 1994. And
the way OAEP works is as follows. So you

162
00:12:54,911 --> 00:13:01,334
取你想加密的明文信息，例如128位的AES密钥
take your message that you wanna encrypt
this for example could be the 128 bits AES

163
00:13:01,334 --> 00:13:06,589
然后首先在明文后面附上一小段密码本
key. And then the first thing you do is
you append a short pad to it. So in this

164
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:11,249
在这里，你在前面附上01，然后再加一组0
case, you put a 01 in the beginning and
then you add a whole bunch of zeroes. How

165
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:16,026
根据标准来定要加多少0
many zeroes is actually depends on the
standard but you know that's supposed like

166
00:13:16,026 --> 00:13:20,686
假设这里有128位0。然后大家也选择一个随机值
they're 128 zeroes in here. And then you
also choose a random value so that this

167
00:13:20,686 --> 00:13:25,521
使得这整个字符串与你的RSA模一样大，比如说2047位
whole string is as big as your RSA modulus
so let's just say this is 2047 bits. Now

168
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:30,065
现在在你应用RSA函数之前，首先取你选的随机数
before you apply the RSA function, you
first of all take the random value that

169
00:13:30,065 --> 00:13:34,491
把它交给哈希函数，这个哈希函数产生一个值
you chose and you feed it into the hash
function. This hash function produces a

170
00:13:34,491 --> 00:13:38,787
这个值与你编码的左边一样大。你把输出求异或
value that's as big as the left hand side
of your encoding. You XOR the outputs.

171
00:13:38,787 --> 00:13:42,768
把得到的结果交给另一个哈希函数，我们叫它g
You feed the result into another hash
function which we call a g. You XOR

172
00:13:42,768 --> 00:13:46,750
你用一个随机值去异或，最后会得到两个值
that with a random value. And then
finally, you get these two values that you

173
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:51,365
你把它们联结起来，好。你把左右相联结
concatenate together. Okay, So, you
concatenate either left side and the

174
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:56,852
得到2047位长的字符串，这也就是
right side that gives you something that
says is 2047 bits long and that's the thing

175
00:13:56,852 --> 00:14:03,131
你应用RSA函数的字符串。结果就是RSA加密
that you apply the RSA function to. And the
result is the RSA encryption. Now there's

176
00:14:03,131 --> 00:14:07,636
现在有一个2001年证明的理论，由藤崎英一郎、
本明、Pointcheval和Stern提出
a theory that was proved in 2001, due to
Fujisaki, Okamoto, Pointcheval, and Stern,

177
00:14:07,636 --> 00:14:12,557
证明了事实上如果你只假设RSA函数是陷门函数
that shows that in fact if all you do is
you, you assume that the RSA function is a

178
00:14:12,557 --> 00:14:17,062
是一个安全的陷门函数，但事实上这个模式
Trapdoor permutation, a secure Trapdoor
permut ation, but in fact this mode of

179
00:14:17,062 --> 00:14:21,686
使用RSA加密是选择密文安全的话，我们还必须假设
encrypting using RSA is in fact chosen
ciphertext secure but we have to

180
00:14:21,686 --> 00:14:26,607
函数h和g是某种理想的哈希函数才行，如我所说
assume that the functions h and g are kind
of ideal hash functions as I said these

181
00:14:26,607 --> 00:14:31,053
这些叫做随机神谕。我们假设h和g是随机函数
are called random oracles. Basically, we
assume that h and g are just random

182
00:14:31,053 --> 00:14:36,293
从它们的定义域映射到它们的值域。当然在实际中
functions from their domains to their
range. In practice of course when OAEP is

183
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:41,277
当实现OAEP时，对于h和g，人们就使用SHA-256
implemented, people just use SHA-256
say for h and g. Why is this called

184
00:14:41,277 --> 00:14:45,618
那为什么这叫做优化非对称加密补齐呢？
为什么要说优化呢？
Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding?
Why is this o? Why does this stands for

185
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:50,070
原因在于，如果你看密文，会注意到
optimal? Well, the reason is if you look
at the ciphertext, you'll notice that the

186
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,690
其密文是尽可能短的。密文与RSA输出一样长
ciphertext is basically as short as it can
be. The ciphertext is exactly the length

187
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:59,286
没有附在密文后面的值
of one RSA output, there are no trailing
values that are appended to the ciphertext

188
00:14:59,286 --> 00:15:03,992
例如ISO标准中，如果大家记得，即使你必须加密
whereas for example, the ISO standard
if you remember even if you had to encrypt

189
00:15:03,992 --> 00:15:08,589
一个非常短的明文，你必须使用RSA加密x
a very short message, what you would have
to do is you would have to encrypt x using

190
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:12,638
然后在x后面附上使用对称加密系统加密的短消息
RSA and then append to that x, the
encryption with the short message under

191
00:15:12,638 --> 00:15:17,126
即使你必须加密128位AES密钥
the symmetric encryption system. So even
if you have just to encrypt a 128 bit AES

192
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:21,411
根据ISO标准，你会获得一个RSA输出加上一段对称密码
key, with the ISO standard you would
get one RSA output plus a symmetric

193
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:26,643
而在OAEP中，你只获得了一个RSA输出，没有其他东西
cipher whereas with OAEP, you just get one
RSA output and nothing else so in that

194
00:15:26,643 --> 00:15:31,090
那么从某种意义上，这是优化的，密文长度是优化的
sense, it's optimal, Optimal in terms of
the length of the ciphertext.

195
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:35,897
有趣的是，这个定理依赖于RSA的性质。事实上
Interestingly, this theorem here really
rely on properties of RSA. And in fact,

196
00:15:35,897 --> 00:15:40,644
如果你使用一个普通的陷门置换，那么这个定理不成立
the theorem is known to be false if
you use a general trapdoor permutation.

197
00:15:40,644 --> 00:15:45,512
其他的置换未必具备RSA的代数性质
Some other permutation doesn't have the
algebraic properties of RSA. So that left

198
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:50,260
剩下的问题是，如果我们有一个普通陷门置换
this question of if we have a general
trapdoor permutation, what is the correct

199
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:55,127
如何正确地使用OAEP呢？实际上，对OAEP有一个小修改
way to do OAEP? And it turns out, there's
a minor modification to OAEP which makes

200
00:15:55,127 --> 00:16:00,115
可以使得结果更为一般。这是Shoup于2001年给出的结果
the result more general. This is a result
due to Shoup back in 2001. Just shows that

201
00:16:00,115 --> 00:16:04,729
证明了如果给我一个普通陷门置换f，实际上
if you give me a general trapdoor
permutation f. It turns out if you replace

202
00:16:04,729 --> 00:16:09,546
如果不用OAEP里的固定补齐，而是使用这个哈希函数w
the fixed pad that's using OAEP by a hash
function, this hash function w, which

203
00:16:09,546 --> 00:16:14,116
它是你要加密的明文m和随机性r的哈希函数
happens to be a hash function of the
message m and the randomness r that

204
00:16:14,116 --> 00:16:18,996
然后在解密时，检测这个哈希函数的值是否正确
you're encrypting with, and then during
decryption, you actually check that this

205
00:16:18,996 --> 00:16:23,875
那么当你解密时，检查w(mr)
hash function value is correct. So when
you decrypt, you actually check the w of

206
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:28,816
是否与明文中这个位置的内容一致
mr is really what's written in this
position in the plaintext. If you do that

207
00:16:28,816 --> 00:16:33,829
这种改进后的OAEP叫做OAEP+。事实上它是CCA安全的
then basically this OAEP called OAEP+.
Is in fact CCS secure, Chosen Ciphertext

208
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:38,078
对任意陷门置换都是选择密文安全的，不必依赖于
Secure for any trapdoor permutation. You
don't have to rely on a specific

209
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:42,621
RSA的特定性质。还有一个结果叫做简单非对称加密补齐
properties of RSA. There's another result
called Simple Asymmetric Encryption

210
00:16:42,621 --> 00:16:47,342
SAEP+，就是说如果要依赖RSA的性质
Padding, SAEP+ which basically says
that if you are gonna rely on properties

211
00:16:47,342 --> 00:16:51,827
那么在特殊情况下，当RSA的公钥指数等于3时
of RSA, then in particular way with RSA
when the public exponent is equal to

212
00:16:51,827 --> 00:16:56,429
实际上你不需要第二阶段的加密工作
3, it turns out you actually don't
need the second stage of encryption. The

213
00:16:56,429 --> 00:17:01,386
这里这个简单的补齐机制使用了函数w
simple padding scheme here again using the
function w is actually already enough to

214
00:17:01,386 --> 00:17:06,321
就足以保证选择密文安全了。那么这些是OAEP的变种
guarantee chosen ciphertext security. So
these are variants OAEP but they're not

215
00:17:06,321 --> 00:17:11,760
但它们并没有被实际使用。我只想提一下，
让大家知道它们的存在
really used. I just wanted to mention and
to let you know they exist. These are not

216
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,239
这些没被使用，而被使用的OAEP已被标准化了
really used mainly OAEP has been
standardized is what's used. Although

217
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:20,974
尽管在实际中，RSA在公钥加密中的最一般的应用
again in reality, the most common
application of RSA for public encryption

218
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:25,729
实际上就是这个被标准化的PKCS1，在HTTPS的RFC中
is in fact this PKCS1 that's
standardized in the HTTPS RFC. So just to

219
00:17:25,729 --> 00:17:30,526
为了确保大家理解清楚这个解密是如何工作的，我问大家
make sure it is clear in your mind how
decryption actually works, let me ask you,

220
00:17:30,526 --> 00:17:35,683
如何解密SAEP密文ct。这里你有密文ct
how would you decrypt an SAEP ciphertext
ct. So here, you're given the ciphertext

221
00:17:35,863 --> 00:17:40,600
问题是下面三种方法中，哪种是正确的密文解密？
ct here and the question is which of these
three methods is the correct way of

222
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:47,177
那么正确答案是第一个，我们来看为什么
decrypting the ciphertext. So the correct
answer is the first one and let's see why.

223
00:17:47,177 --> 00:17:52,181
有了密文，我们首先需要应用RSA逆函数
Well, given the ciphertext the first thing
what we need to do is apply the RSA

224
00:17:52,181 --> 00:17:57,250
作用于密文，我们会得到RSA明文
inverse functions, the ciphertext and that
will give us the RSA plaintext which

225
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:02,447
正好就是x和r。那么我们得到了这里的x和r
happens to be in this case x and r. So we
get this x and r here. The next thing we

226
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:07,709
接下来我们需要使用函数h计算r的哈希值，然后把结果与x异或
need to do is we need to hash r using the
function h and XOR the result with x and

227
00:18:07,709 --> 00:18:12,152
这会给我们m和w(m,r)。最后我们需要确保
that will give us m and wm, r. And the
last we need to do is to make sure that

228
00:18:12,152 --> 00:18:17,213
补齐W(m,r)是正确的，这样我们检查w是否等于W(m,r)
the pad W(m,r) is correct so we check that
in fact w is equal to W(m,r) and if so we

229
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:22,711
如果是，我们输出m；如果不是，我们输出⊥，表示密文无效
output m and if not, we output bottom to
say that the ciphertext is invalid and

230
00:18:22,711 --> 00:18:27,304
因此解密算法拒绝了它。顺便说下，我想强调
the decryption algorithm rejects it. And
by the way I'd like to emphasize that this

231
00:18:27,304 --> 00:18:31,731
解密中的这个补齐检查在我们看过的所有的机制中都是很重要的
checking of the pad during decryption is
crucial in all of the schemes that we

232
00:18:31,731 --> 00:18:36,956
例如OAEP+和SAEP+，就是这样解密的
just saw. So for example, in both OAEP+ and SAEP+, it's doing decryption.

233
00:18:36,956 --> 00:18:42,917
检查补齐是否正确是很重要的
It's very important to check that the pad
is in fact correct so that the value of w

234
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:48,534
这样解密时，你在这里得到的w值就是哈希值W(m,r)
that you get here during the encryption
really is the hash under the capital W of

235
00:18:48,534 --> 00:18:54,152
类似地在OAEP中，在解密时，这个检查也很重要
m and r and similarly on OAEP, it's very
important to check it during decryption.

236
00:18:54,152 --> 00:18:59,544
事实上这个补齐值是个常数010000000
In fact, the value of the pad is the
constant 010000000. And of course if it

237
00:18:59,544 --> 00:19:04,556
当然如果它不是01000，你就输出⊥，说密文是无效的
happens to be not 01000 then you output
bottom and you say the ciphertext is

238
00:19:04,556 --> 00:19:08,713
我想指出的最后一点是，实际上实现OAEP
invalid. The last thing I wanna point out
is that actually implementing OAEP can be

239
00:19:08,713 --> 00:19:12,679
可能是很困难的，我们来看为什么。
假设你写了一个OAEP解密程序
quite tricky and let's see why. So
supposed you have, you write an OAEP

240
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:17,347
取密文为输入，首先
decryption routine that takes the
ciphertext as input. The first thing you

241
00:19:17,347 --> 00:19:22,330
对密文应用RSA逆函数
would do is you would apply the RSA
inverse function to the ciphertext and you

242
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:27,565
比如说你希望得到n位值输出，2047位
would say well, you expect to get an n bit
value out, you know 2047 bits in the case

243
00:19:27,565 --> 00:19:32,548
在2048位RSA模的情形下。如果你获得了某个
of 2048 bit RSA modulus and if you get
something that's bigger than two to the

244
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:37,150
比2^2047大的数，你就拒绝。我们说错误=1，然后离开
2047, you say reject. We say error = one
and we go to Exit. The next thing we're

245
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:42,014
接下来我们检查补齐是否是正确的
gonna do is we're gonna check whether the
pad is in fact the correct pad and again

246
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:46,820
如果补齐不正确，我们还是拒绝和离开
if the pad is not the correct pad, then
again, we're gonna reject and go to Exit.

247
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:51,512
这个实现的问题是，我希望大家已经猜到了
The problem with this implementation is
well by now I hope you kind of guessed it

248
00:19:51,512 --> 00:19:55,918
这对于计时攻击来说是脆弱的
is it's vulnerable to a timing attack,
right. So essentially by leaking timing

249
00:19:55,918 --> 00:20:00,382
通过泄漏时间信息，攻击者可以解出是什么导致了错误
information the attacker can now figure
out what caused the error. Was it, that

250
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:04,674
是RSA解密后数太大的错误
was there an error the RSA decryption
happened to be too big or was there an

251
00:20:04,674 --> 00:20:08,909
还是因为补齐太大的错误？如果攻击者
error because the pad happened to be too
large? And if the attacker can this

252
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:13,257
通过计时可以区分这两种错误。那么与Bleichenbacher类似
distinguish these two errors say by
timing. Then it turns out similar to the

253
00:20:13,257 --> 00:20:17,889
实际上是可能完全解密任何你选择的密文的
Bleichenbacher attack, it's possible to
completely decrypt any ciphertext of your

254
00:20:17,889 --> 00:20:22,408
一丁点的信息泄漏
choice. Just at very, very, very small
leak of information would completely allow

255
00:20:22,408 --> 00:20:28,203
都可以让攻击者完全解密任何他想要的密文
the attacker to decrypt completely any
ciphertext that he wants to. So this shows

256
00:20:28,203 --> 00:20:32,624
这展示了，即使你正确地实现了OAEP的数学部分
that if you, even if you implement the
mathematics of OAEP decryption correctly,

257
00:20:32,624 --> 00:20:37,101
你也可能会搞砸，是自己暴露于计时攻击中
you can very easily mess up and open
yourself up to a timing attack which would

258
00:20:37,101 --> 00:20:41,074
这会使得你的实现是完全不安全的。通常的教训是
make your implementation completely
insecure. So as usual, the lesson is,

259
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:45,215
不要自己去实现密码学，特别是RSA、OAEP
don't implement crypto yourself in
particular, RSA OAEP is particularly

260
00:20:45,215 --> 00:20:49,692
自己去实现将是非常危险的。就使用标准库即可
dangerous to implement yourself. Just use one
of the standard libraries for example,

261
00:20:49,692 --> 00:20:54,281
例如OpenSSL有一个OAEP实现，当然他们做得非常小心
OpenSSL has an OAEP implementation and of
course what they do is very careful to

262
00:20:54,281 --> 00:20:59,038
确保OAEP解密的运行时间总是相同的
make sure that the running time of OAEP
decrypt is always the same no matter what

263
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:03,401
无论发送什么错误。好，那么我们就说到这
causes the error. Okay, So let's stop here
and then in the next segment we'll talk

264
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:07,435
下节我们讨论RSA陷门置换的安全性
about the security of the RSA trapdoor
permutation.
