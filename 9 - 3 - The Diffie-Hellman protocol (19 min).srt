1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,069
本节我们看Diffie-Hellman协议
In this segment, we're gonna look at the
Diffie-Hellman protocol, which is our

2
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:08,234
这是我们的第一个实用的密钥交换机制。
那么让我为大家讲一下目前的设定。
first practical key exchange mechanism. So
let me remind you of the settings. Our

3
00:00:08,234 --> 00:00:12,442
我们的朋友Alice和Bob素未谋面，却想交换一个共享密钥
friends here, Alice and Bob, have never
met and yet they wanna exchange a shared

4
00:00:12,442 --> 00:00:16,445
然后他们可以使用这个密钥来用于相互安全通信
secret key that they can then use to
communicate securely with one another.

5
00:00:16,445 --> 00:00:20,088
这两节我们只看对窃听攻击的安全性
In this segment and the next, we're only
gonna be looking at eavesdropping

6
00:00:20,088 --> 00:00:23,937
换句话说，我们只关心窃听攻击者
security. In other words, we only care
about eavesdroppers. The attackers are

7
00:00:23,937 --> 00:00:27,992
攻击者不能篡改网络中的数据
actually not allowed to tamper with data
in the network. They're not allowed to

8
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:32,046
他们不能修改数据包，不能以任何方式改数据包
inject packets. They're not allowed to
change packets in any way. All they do is

9
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:36,336
他们只能窃听网络流量。在密钥交换协议的最后
to just eavesdrop on the traffic. And at
the end of the protocol, the key exchange

10
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:40,880
我们的朋友Alice和Bob应该有一个共享密钥
protocol our friends Alice and Bob should
have a shared secret key but the attacker

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,031
但窃听攻击者无法知道交换的密钥是什么
namely the eavesdropper has no idea what
that key's gonna be. In the previous

12
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:49,343
上一节我们看了所谓的Merkle谜题的协议
segment we looked at a key segment called
Merkle puzzles. That's just using block

13
00:00:49,343 --> 00:00:53,708
只使用分组密码和哈希函数。我还告诉大家
ciphers or hash functions. And I showed
you that there that basically the attacker

14
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:57,487
攻击者有一个平方鸿沟，相比于参与者。换句话说
has a quadratic gap compared to the
participants. In other words if the

15
00:00:57,487 --> 00:01:01,799
如果参与者花了与N成正比的时间，那么攻击者
participants spent time proportional to N
the attacker can break the protocol in

16
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:06,163
能在与N平方成正比的时间里破解这个协议。
因此这个协议从应用角度来看是不安全的
time proportional to N squared. And as a
result that protocol is too insecure to be

17
00:01:06,163 --> 00:01:10,369
本节我们研究，我们能否做同样的事情
considered practical. In this segment we
are going to ask whether we can do the

18
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:14,733
但现在能获得一个指数级鸿沟，横亘在
same thing but now we'd like to achieve an
exponential gap between the attacker's

19
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:19,051
攻击者和参与者的工作之间。换句话说，Alice和Bob
work ended up in the participant's work.
In other words, Alice and Bob might do

20
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:23,602
可以做与N成正比的工作，但为了破解这个协议
work proportional to N, but to break the
protocol the attacker is gonna have to do

21
00:01:23,602 --> 00:01:27,876
攻击者必须做与N的某个指数级成正比的工作量
work proportional to some exponential in
N. So now there's an exponential gap

22
00:01:27,876 --> 00:01:32,702
现在，在参与者和攻击者的工作之间
有一条指数级鸿沟。那么如我上节所说
between the participants work and the
attacker's work. So as I said in the

23
00:01:32,702 --> 00:01:37,985
我们不能获得这个指数级鸿沟，仅凭
previous segment we can't achieve this
exponential gap from block ciphers like AES

24
00:01:37,985 --> 00:01:43,143
想AES或SHA-256这样的分组密码技术。我们必须
使用拥有比对称原型更多结构的难解问题
or SHA-256. We have to use hard problems
that have more structure than just those

25
00:01:43,143 --> 00:01:48,714
那么我们使用一点代数
symmetric primitives. And so instead what
we're gonna do is use a little bit of algebra.

26
00:01:48,714 --> 00:01:51,600
本节我将描述Diffie-Hellman协议
In this segment I'm gonna
describe the Diffie-Hellman protocol very

27
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,769
以很具体的形式，不是很形式化。
下周我们还会回到Diffie-Hellman协议
concretely and somewhat informally. When
we're gonna come back to Diffie-Hellman next week

28
00:01:55,769 --> 00:02:00,090
我们将更为抽象地描述这个协议
and we're gonna describe the protocol more
abstractly and we're gonna do a much more

29
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,198
我们将对这个协议进行更为严格的安全性分析。
那么Diffie-Hellman协议是如何工作的呢？
rigorous security analysis of this
protocol. Okay, so how does Diffie-Hellman

30
00:02:04,198 --> 00:02:08,173
首先，我们选某个固定的大质数
work? What we're gonna do is, first of
all, we're gonna fix some large prime

31
00:02:08,334 --> 00:02:12,684
记之为p。我通常用p表示质数
which I'm gonna call p. Actually p I'll
usually use to denote primes. And you

32
00:02:12,684 --> 00:02:16,820
大家应该把它想象成非常大的质数。比如
should be thinking of really gigantic
primes. Like, primes that are made up of

33
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:21,009
有600个十进制位的质数。如果大家喜欢用二进制的话
600 digits are so. And just for those of
you who like to think in binary, a 600

34
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:25,413
600个十进制位大约相当于2000个二进制位
digit prime roughly corresponds to about
2000 bits. So just writing down the prime

35
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:29,932
写下了约两千位的质数。然后我们选一个
固定的整数g
takes about two kilo bits of data. And
then we're also gonna fix an integer g

36
00:02:29,932 --> 00:02:35,067
g正好在从1到p的范围中。这里的p和g
that happens to live in the range one to
p. So these values p and g are parameters

37
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:40,014
是Diffie-Hellman协议的参数。它们一经选择就不再改变
of the Diffie-Hellman protocol. They are
chosen once and they're fixed forever. Now

38
00:02:40,014 --> 00:02:45,087
现在这个协议如下工作。这是我们的朋友Alice和Bob
the protocol works as follow. So here's
our friends Alice and Bob. So what Alice's

39
00:02:45,087 --> 00:02:50,347
开始时Alice选择某个随机数a，范围是1到p-1
going to do is she's gonna starts off by
choosing some random number a in the range 1 to p-1

40
00:02:50,347 --> 00:02:55,420
然后她将计算g^a mod p
And then she is gonna compute
the number g to the power of a modulo p.

41
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,802
她计算这个指数，然后将结果取质数p的模
Okay, so she computes this exponention,
and reduces the result modular the prime p.

42
00:02:59,802 --> 00:03:04,407
下一章中我们将看到如何有效地计算这个有限域上的指数
And we're actually going to see how to
compute this efficiently the next module,

43
00:03:04,407 --> 00:03:07,817
现在请大家姑且相信我，这是可以有效计算的
so for now just believe me that this
computation can be done efficiently.

44
00:03:07,817 --> 00:03:13,118
现在，我们记A为这个计算的结果
Now, let's call capital A the result of this
value. So, what Alice will do is she will

45
00:03:13,118 --> 00:03:17,501
那么Alice会把A发送给Bob。现在Bob做同样的事情
send capital A over to Bob. Now Bob is
going to do the same thing. He's going to

46
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:22,161
他选择一个随机数b，范围从1到p-1
choose a random number b in the range 1
to p-1. He's going to compute g to

47
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:26,322
Bob计算g^b mod p，我们记结果为B
the b module of p and let's call this
number B and he's going to send this

48
00:03:26,322 --> 00:03:31,114
然后Bob把B发送给Alice。那么Alice发送了A给Bob，
Bob发送了B给Alice
number B over to Alice. So Alice sends A
to Bob. Bob sends B To Alice. And now

49
00:03:31,114 --> 00:03:36,848
现在他们俩宣布，他们已经共享了一个密钥。
那么这个共享的密钥是什么呢？
they claim that they can generate a shared
secret key. So what's a shared secret key?

50
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:41,968
我们来定义它，我们先记之为K_AB
Well, it's defined as. Let's call it
K_AB. And it's basically defined as the

51
00:03:41,968 --> 00:03:47,410
K_AB定义为g^ab mod p。现在Diffie-Hellman在
1976年的一个惊人的观察结果是
value g to the power of a times b. Now the
amazing observation of Diffie-Hellman had

52
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:53,040
事实上双方都可以计算这个值g^ab mod p
back in 1976 is that in fact both parties
can compute this value g to the ab.

53
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,738
我们看，Alice可以计算这个值，因为她可以取值B
So let's see, Alice can compute this value
because she can take her value B that she

54
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:04,232
B是Bob给她的。她可以取值B，计算B^a mod p
received from Bob. She can take this value
B, raise it to the power of a and, let's

55
00:04:04,232 --> 00:04:09,116
她会获得g^ab mod p
see, what she'll get is g to the b to the
power of b. And by the rules of

56
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:14,935
根据指数规则，(g^b)^a=(g^a)^b mod p
exponentiation, g to the power of b to the
power of a is equal to g to the ab. Bob

57
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:19,986
Bob实际上也可以做类似的事情，那么
他的目标是计算(g^a)^b mod p
turns out, can do something similar, so
his goal is to compute g to the a to the b,

58
00:04:19,986 --> 00:04:24,972
答案依然是g^ab mod p，所以Alice和Bob
都可以计算出K_AB
which again, is g to the ab, so both
Alice and Bob will have computed K_AB, and

59
00:04:24,972 --> 00:04:32,567
我问大家，Bob是怎么计算g^ab mod p的？
let me ask you, how does Bob actually
compute this quantity g to the ab?

60
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:37,894
他取Alice给他的A
Well so all he does is he takes the value A that
he received from Alice and he raises it to

61
00:04:37,894 --> 00:04:43,412
计算A^b mod p，就得到了共享密钥g^ab mod p
his own secret b and that gives him the
shared secret g to the ab. So you can see

62
00:04:43,412 --> 00:04:48,450
大家可以看到，尽管双方计算的值不一样
now that both parties even though they
seemingly computed different values. In

63
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:53,495
事实上他们会得到同样的值g^ab mod p
fact they both end up with the same value
namely g ab module p. I should mention by

64
00:04:53,495 --> 00:04:57,703
我应该顺便提到，Martin Hellman和Whit Diffie
于1976年提出这一协议
the way that Martin Hellman and Wig
Diffie came up with this protocol back in

65
00:04:57,703 --> 00:05:01,752
当时Martin Hellman是斯坦福的教授，
而Whit Diffie是他的研究生
1976. Martin Hellman was a professor here
at Stanford and Wig Diffie was his

66
00:05:01,752 --> 00:05:06,120
他们提出的这个协议真正改变了这个世界
graduate student. They came up with this
protocol and this protocol really changed

67
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,541
它开创了密码学的新纪元
the world. In that it introduced this new
age in cryptography. Where now it's not just

68
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:14,536
现在不仅仅是关于开发分组密码，而且是关于
about developing block ciphers but it's
actually about designing algebraic

69
00:05:14,536 --> 00:05:19,293
设计基于代数的协议，使之拥有类似我们这里的性质
protocols that have properties like the
one we see here. So you notice that what

70
00:05:19,293 --> 00:05:24,336
大家注意，这个协议顺利工作的本质原因
是指数的代数性质
makes this protocol works is basically
properties of exponentiation. Namely that,

71
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:29,443
即(g^b)^a = (g^a)^b
g to the b to the power of a is the same
as g to the a to the power of b, okay?

72
00:05:29,443 --> 00:05:33,568
这些是指数的性质。现在当我描述
These are just properties of
exponentiations. Now when I describe a

73
00:05:33,568 --> 00:05:38,041
一个像我刚才展示给大家的协议时，
大家应该想到的真正问题
protocol like the one I just showed you.
The real question that should be in your

74
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:41,941
不是这个协议为什么能工作。换句话说，
很容易验证这点
mind is not why the protocol works. In
other words, it's very easy to verify

75
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:45,840
事实上，Alice和Bob最后会得到同样的密钥
that, in fact, both Alice and Bob end up
with the same secret key. The bigger

76
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,636
更重要的问题是，为什么这个协议是安全的？
换句话说，为什么一个窃听者
question is why is this protocol secure?
In other words, why is it that an

77
00:05:49,636 --> 00:05:53,847
无法根据双方发出的A、B，解出共享密钥？
eavesdropper cannot figure out the same
shared key due to the AB that both Alice

78
00:05:53,847 --> 00:05:57,902
让我们稍作分析，如我所说
and Bob computed by themselves? So let's
analyze this a little bit, then, like I

79
00:05:57,902 --> 00:06:02,114
下周我们进行更进一步的分析
said, we're gonna do a much more in-depth
analysis next week. But, let's, for now,

80
00:06:02,114 --> 00:06:06,221
现在我们先直观地看一下问什么这个协议是安全的
just see intuitively why this protocol is
gonna be secure. Well, what does the

81
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:11,106
窃听者能看到什么？他能看到质数和生成元
eavesdropper see? Well, he sees the prime
and the generator. These are just fixed
(这里质数是指上文的p，生成元是指g)

82
00:06:11,106 --> 00:06:15,876
这些值是永远固定不变的，每个人都知道它们。
攻击者还能看到Alice发给Bob的值A
forever and everybody knows who they are.
He also sees the value that Alice sent to

83
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:20,531
他还能看到Bob发给Alice的值B
Bob, namely this capital A. And he sees
the value that Bob sent to Alice, namely

84
00:06:20,531 --> 00:06:25,187
问题是，窃听者能计算出g^ab mod p
this capital B. And the question is, can
the, can the eavesdropper compute g to the

85
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:29,899
仅根据这四个值吗？更一般地
ab just given these four values? So more
generally, what we can do is we can define

86
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:34,497
我们可以定义这个Diffie-Hellman函数。
我们说，Diffie-Hellman函数
this Diffie-Hellman function. So we'll say
that the Diffie-Hellman function is defined

87
00:06:34,497 --> 00:06:39,373
定义在某个值g上，问题是，给定g^a和g^b
based on some value g. And the question is
given g to the a, and g to the b. Can you

88
00:06:39,373 --> 00:06:44,743
能否计算g^ab？我们在问，计算这个
compute g to the ab? And what we're
asking is how hard is it to compute this

89
00:06:44,743 --> 00:06:49,580
很大的质数模p乘法群上的函数，有多困难？
记得p大约有600个十进制位
function module over very large prime p.
Remember p was something like 600 digits.

90
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,968
所以真正的问题是，这个Diffie-Hellman函数
So the real question we need to answer is
how hard is this, is this Diffie-Hellman

91
00:06:53,968 --> 00:06:58,850
有多难解？我来告诉大家目前已知的事实。
介绍这个质数正好有n位长
function? So let me show you what's known
about this. So suppose the prime happens

92
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:04,406
在我们这里比如说n=2000位
to be n bits long. Okay, so in our case
say n is 2,000 bits. It turns out the best

93
00:07:04,406 --> 00:07:08,783
实际上计算Diffie-Hellman函数，已知最好的算法
known algorithm for computing the
DiffieCHellman function. Is actually a

94
00:07:08,783 --> 00:07:12,853
是一个更为一般的算法，用来计算离散对数函数
more general algorithm that computes the
discrete log function, which we're gonna

95
00:07:12,853 --> 00:07:16,822
我们下周讨论它。但现在，我们就说这个算法
talk about next week. But for now, let's
just say that this algorithm computes a

96
00:07:16,822 --> 00:07:20,742
能计算Diffie-Hellman函数。这个算法叫做
普通数域筛法
Diffie-Hellman function. The algorithm is
called a general number field sieve. I'm

97
00:07:20,742 --> 00:07:24,912
我这里不描述它是如何工作的，不过如果大家
想听一听它是如何工作的
not gonna describe how it works, although
if you'd want to hear how it works, let me

98
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:28,982
告诉我们，我们会在课程的最后开一个特殊专题
know, and that could be one of the special
topics that we cover at the end of the

99
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:33,002
有趣的是，这个算法的运行时间是指数级的
course. But the interesting thing is that
its running time is exponential in

100
00:07:33,002 --> 00:07:36,771
指数大约是n的立方根。换句话说，运行时间
roughly the cube root of n. In other
words, the running time is roughly e to

101
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:41,028
大约是e的n的立方根次方。事实上这个算法的
运行时间的严格表达式
the power of o of cube root of n. So in
fact the exact expression for the running

102
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:44,853
要比这个复杂得多
time, of this algorithm is much more
complicated than this. I'm deliberately

103
00:07:44,853 --> 00:07:49,035
我故意简化了，以求直击要点
simplifying it here just to kind of get
the point across. The point that I want to

104
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:52,809
我想强调的一点是，事实上，这不是严格的指数时间的算法
emphasize is that in fact, this is not
quite an exponential time algorithm.

105
00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:57,093
指数时间是指e^n。这个算法有时叫做亚指数算法
Exponential would be e to the power of n.
This is sometimes called a sub-exponential

106
00:07:57,093 --> 00:08:01,377
因为这里的指数项正比于n的立方根
algorithm because the exponent is really
just proportional to the cube root of n,

107
00:08:01,377 --> 00:08:05,847
而不是n。这说明即使这个问题很难
as opposed to linear n. What this says is
that even though this problem is quite

108
00:08:05,847 --> 00:08:10,360
他也不是真正的指数级时间的问题
difficult, it's not really an exponential
time problem. The running time in the

109
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,175
运行时间的指数是与n的立方根成正比的
exponent is gonna be just proportional to
the cube root of n. So let's look at some

110
00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:19,848
那么我们来看几个例子。假设我正好在看一个模
examples. Suppose I happen to be looking
at a modulus that happens to be about a

111
00:08:19,848 --> 00:08:23,879
有大于一千位长。这个算法是说
thousand bits long. What this algorithm
says is that we can solve the

112
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,436
我们可以解决Diffie-Hellman问题，以时间
大约是e的1024的立方根次方
Diffie-Hellman problem in time that's
approximately e to the cube root of 1,024.

113
00:08:28,436 --> 00:08:33,285
这不是很准确，事实上指数上有一些常数项
Now this is not really correct, in fact
there are more constants in the exponent.

114
00:08:33,285 --> 00:08:38,192
但只看要点的话，我们可以说算法的运行时间
But again, just to get, the point across,
we can say that the running time would be

115
00:08:38,192 --> 00:08:42,866
大约是e的1024的立方根次方，这个值其实很小，
大约是e的10次方(约22000)
roughly e to the cube root of 1,024; which
is actually very small, roughly e to the 10.

116
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:47,231
这个简单的例子告诉大家，如果你有一个亚指数级算法
So the simple example shows you that
if you have a sub-exponential algorithm,

117
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:51,589
大家看到即使这个问题规模很大，比如1000位
you see that even if the problem is quite
large, like 1,000 bits. Because of the

118
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:56,277
因为这个立方根的作用，其实总体并没有那么大
cube root effect the exponent actually is not
that big overall. Now to be honest I'm

119
00:08:56,277 --> 00:09:00,849
说实话我就讲到这里了。普通数域筛法
actually lying here. General number field
sieve actually have many other

120
00:09:00,849 --> 00:09:05,420
在指数上有许多其他常数，不如事实上
这个根本不是10
constants in the exponents so in fact this
is not going to be ten at all. It's

121
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,816
而是类似于80的样子。因为指数上的各种常数
actually going to be something like 80.
Because of various constants in the

122
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:14,622
但是大家看到这个问题依然比2的1000次方
exponents. But nevertheless but you see
the problem is much harder than say 2 to
(这里讲反了。筛法降低了问题复杂性)

123
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:19,428
困难得多。尽管描述它需要1000位，但解决它
the 1000. Even though describing it takes
1,000 bits, solving it does not take time

124
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:23,587
不需要1000次方的时间。这里我把表往下拉
to the 1,000. So here I roll down the
table that kind of shows you the rough

125
00:09:23,587 --> 00:09:27,309
给大家看大体上，比较一下破解Diffie-Hellman协议
difficulty of breaking down the
Diffie-Hellman protocol compared to the

126
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:31,785
和破解分组密码的难度，给定合适的位数。例如
difficulty of breaking down a cipher with
a appropriate number of bits. For example,

127
00:09:31,785 --> 00:09:36,261
如果你的密码有80位密钥，那大概需要1000位的模
if your cipher has 80 bit keys. That would
be roughly comparable to using 1,000 bit

128
00:09:36,261 --> 00:09:40,792
换句话说，破解一个80位的密码，大约需要2的80次方的时间
modules. In other words breaking a cipher
with 80 bit keys takes time roughly 2 to the 80

129
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:45,053
意味着如果你的Diffie-Hellman函数有1000位的模
which means that breaking if you have Diffie-Hellman function with a 1,000

130
00:09:45,053 --> 00:09:47,701
破解它需要2的80次方的时间
bit module will take time 2 to the 80.

131
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:53,989
如果你的密码使用128位密钥，比如AES，那么
你应该使用3000位的模
If your cipher uses 128 bit keys like AES, you should be
really using a 3,000 bit modulus,

132
00:09:53,989 --> 00:09:58,734
即使没有人真正这样做。实际中，人们使用2000位的模
even though nobody really does this. In reality
people would use 2,000 bit modulus. And

133
00:09:58,734 --> 00:10:03,083
那么如果你的密钥非常大，比如说如果
我们使用256位AES密钥
then if your key is very large, like if
we're using a 256 bit AES key, then in

134
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:07,715
那么事实上你的模需要非常大。大家可以看到
fact your modulus needs to be very, very
large. Again, you, you can really see the

135
00:10:07,715 --> 00:10:12,346
这里立方根的作用了。由于这个立方根的影响，
我们将密钥大小翻倍时
cube root effect here. We doubled the size
of our key and because of the cube root

136
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:16,752
意味着我们必须增加模的大小，倍数为
effect, what that means is we have to
increase the size of, of our modulus by a

137
00:10:16,752 --> 00:10:21,327
2的立方，也就是8倍，这就是这个15000的由来
factor of two cubed, namely a factor of
eight, which is where this 15,000 comes from.

138
00:10:21,327 --> 00:10:25,952
我应该再提一下，这并不是严格的8倍
from. And again I should mention there's
not exactly a factor of eight because of

139
00:10:25,952 --> 00:10:30,251
因为指数上有其他常数项。那么这张表不错
the extra constants in the exponent. So
this is a nice table that shows you that

140
00:10:30,251 --> 00:10:34,481
它告诉大家，如果大家要使用Diffie-Hellman协议
来交换会话密钥
if you're gonna be using Diffie-Hellman to
exchange, a session key. And that session

141
00:10:34,481 --> 00:10:38,608
用于分组密码的会话密钥要有合适的密钥大小
key is gonna be used for a block cipher
with a certain key size, this table shows

142
00:10:38,608 --> 00:10:42,633
这张表为大家展示了，需要使用的模大小，
使得密钥交换协议的安全性
you what modular size you need to use so
that the security of the key exchange

143
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:46,709
和你之后使用的分组密码的安全性相当
protocol is comparable to the security of
the block cipher you're gonna be using after.

144
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:50,837
现在这个最后一行应该会困扰着大家
Now this last row should
really be disturbing to you. I should tell

145
00:10:50,837 --> 00:10:54,913
我应该告诉大家，要使用如此之大的模很成问题
you that working with such a large modulus
is very problematic. This is actually

146
00:10:54,913 --> 00:10:59,040
速度会很慢，那么问题是，我们能否做得更好？
gonna be quite slow, and so the question
is whether there is anything better that

147
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,832
实际上是有的。事实上，我描述Diffie-Hellman函数的方法
we can do? And it turns out there is. In
fact the way I describe the Diffie-Hellman

148
00:11:03,832 --> 00:11:08,984
正是Diffie和Hellman在1976年描述的方法
function is I describe it at the way
Diffie and Hellman described it in 1976

149
00:11:08,984 --> 00:11:13,516
使用了质数模的算术。质数模算术的问题是
using arithmetic module of primes. The
problem with arithmetic modular primes is

150
00:11:13,516 --> 00:11:17,539
Diffie-Hellman函数难以计算，但不如大家想的那么难
that the Diffie-Hellman function is hard
to compute, but it's not as hard as you'd

151
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:21,611
有这个立方根的影响，使之比大家想的稍容易些
like. There's this cube root effect that
makes it a little easier than what you'd

152
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:26,158
那么问题是，我们能否在其他的设定下，
运行Diffie-Hellman协议
really like. And so the question is can we
run the Diffie-Hellman protocol in other

153
00:11:26,158 --> 00:11:30,300
实际上答案是肯定的。事实上我们可以
settings. And it turns out the answer is
yes. In fact we can literally translate

154
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,308
把Diffie-Hellman协议从质数模算术的设定
the Diffie-Hellman protocol from an
arithmetic model of primes to a different

155
00:11:34,308 --> 00:11:38,752
翻译成不同类型的代数对象，然后在其他的
type of algebraic object and solving the
Diffie-Hellman problem on that other

156
00:11:38,752 --> 00:11:43,196
代数对象上解Diffie-Hellman问题将是困难得多。
这个其他的代数对象就是
algebraic object is much, much harder.
This other algebraic object is what's

157
00:11:43,196 --> 00:11:47,758
所谓的椭圆曲线。如我所说，计算定义在椭圆曲线域上的
Diffie-Hellman函数
called an elliptic curve. And as I said,
computing the Diffie-Hellman function on

158
00:11:47,758 --> 00:11:52,735
要比计算质数模乘法群上的Diffie-Hellman困难得多
these elliptic curves is much harder than
computing the Diffie-Hellman modulo primes.

159
00:11:52,735 --> 00:11:57,476
因为问题更加困难，现在我们可以使用小得多的代数对象
Because the problem is so much harder, now
we can use much smaller objects in

160
00:11:57,476 --> 00:12:02,453
特别地，我们使用仅有160位或80位或
particular, you know we'd be using primes
that are only a 160 bits or 80 bit keys or

161
00:12:02,453 --> 00:12:06,780
512位的质数，用于256位的分组密钥。那么因为这些模
only 512 bits for 256 bit keys. So because
these module don't grow as

162
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,914
在椭圆曲线上增长得不快，通常从使用模算术
fast on elliptic curves, there's generally
a slow transition away from using module

163
00:12:10,914 --> 00:12:14,949
到使用椭圆曲线有一个缓慢的转换。
我这里先不为大家描述椭圆曲线
arithmetic, to using elliptic curves. I'm
not going to describe elliptic curves

164
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:18,735
但如果这是大家想学习的
right now for you, but if this is
something you'd like to learn about I can

165
00:12:18,735 --> 00:12:22,421
我可以留到本课程的最后一周，届时讨论更多高级话题
do that at the very last week of the
course, when we discuss more advanced
(实际上在第二季，敬请期待)

166
00:12:22,421 --> 00:12:27,149
但事实上当我们下周回到Diffie-Hellman时
topics. But in fact when we come back to
Diffie-Hellman next week I'm gonna describe it

167
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:31,933
我将更为抽象地描述它，这样你使用的代数结构就不重要了
more abstractly so that it really doesn't
matter which algebraic structure you use

168
00:12:31,933 --> 00:12:36,831
无论使用质数模算术，还是使用椭圆曲线域
whether you use arithmetic model of primes
or whether you use a elliptic curve we

169
00:12:36,831 --> 00:12:41,557
我们都可以将整个过程抽象出来，然后使用
这个Diffie-Hellman概念
can kinda abstract that whole issue away
and then use the Diffie-Hellman concept a for

170
00:12:41,557 --> 00:12:46,109
进行密钥交换，以及一些其他事情。如我所说
key exchange and for other things as well.
And as I said we'll see that more

171
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:50,321
我们下周还会看到更多的抽象。通常我想展示这个漂亮的协议
abstractly next week. So as usual I wanna
show that this beautiful protocol that I

172
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:54,307
就像我刚刚展示给大家的，Diffie-Hellman协议，
对抗主动攻击时，是完全不安全的
just showed you, the Diffie-Hellman protocol,
is as is, is actually completely insecure

173
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:58,195
它是完全不安全的
against an active attack. Namely, it's
completely insecure against what's called

174
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:02,132
当存在所谓的中间人攻击。我们需要对这个协议
the man in the middle attack. We need to
do something more than this protocol to

175
00:13:02,132 --> 00:13:06,019
做些补充，让它对中间人攻击也是安全的。
下周，我们将再次回到Diffie-Hellman协议
make is secure against man in the middle.
And again we're gonna come back to Diffie

176
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:10,135
让它能安全地抵抗中间人攻击。好，那现在我们看
Hellman and make it secure against man in
the middle next week. Okay. So let's see

177
00:13:10,135 --> 00:13:14,649
为什么我刚才展示给大家的这个协议
对主动攻击是不安全的
why the protocol that I just showed you is
insecure against active attacks. Well

178
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:18,767
假设我们有这个中间人，他试图窃听
suppose we have this man in the middle
that's trying to eavesdrop on the

179
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:23,393
Alice和Bob之间的会话。协议开始时
conversation between Alice and Bob. Well
so, the protocol starts with Alice sending

180
00:13:23,563 --> 00:13:28,309
Alice发送g^a给Bob。那么中间人截获了这个g^a
g to the a over to Bob. Well, so the man
in the middle is gonna intercept that and

181
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:32,777
他将取Alice发出的信息，换成他自己的信息
he's gonna take the message that Alice
sent and he's gonna replace it with his

182
00:13:32,777 --> 00:13:37,113
我们记为A'，写成g^a'
own message. So it's called A', And
let's write that is g to the a'.

183
00:13:37,113 --> 00:13:41,939
所以中间人选择了他自己的a'
Okay? So the man in the middle chooses his
own a' and what he sends to Bob is

184
00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:46,588
把g^a'发送给Bob。现在可怜的Bob并不知道
actually g to the a'. Now poor Bob
doesn't know that the man in the middle

185
00:13:46,588 --> 00:13:51,356
中间人对通信流量做了手脚，他只能获得值A'
actually did anything to this traffic, all
he sees is he got the value A'. As

186
00:13:51,356 --> 00:13:55,946
他目前只知道，这个值来自Alice，那他怎么回复？
far as he knows, that value came from
Alice. So what is he gonna do in response?

187
00:13:55,946 --> 00:14:00,723
Bob会回复他的值B=g^b给Alice
Well, he's gonna send back his value B out
which is g to the b back to Alice. Well

188
00:14:00,723 --> 00:14:05,457
中间人截获了这个B
again the man in the middle is gonna
intercept this B. He's gonna generate his

189
00:14:05,457 --> 00:14:10,434
他将产生自己的b'，然后发送B'=g^b'给Alice
own b' and what he actually sends
back to Alice is B' which is g to the b'.

190
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:16,807
现在会发生什么？Alice将计算她的密钥
Okay, now what happens? Well
Alice is gonna compute her part of the

191
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:22,808
她得到g^ab'。Bob也会计算他的密钥
secret key and she's gonna get g to the ab'. Bob is gonna compute his part of

192
00:14:22,808 --> 00:14:28,281
他会得到g^ba'
the secret key and he's gonna get g to the
b times a'. Okay, these now you

193
00:14:28,281 --> 00:14:33,592
现在大家注意到这些不是一样的密钥。而对于中间人
notice these are not the same keys. In the
man in the middle because he knows both A'

194
00:14:33,592 --> 00:14:38,903
他既知道A'又知道B'，他既可以计算g^ab'
也可以计算g^ba'
and B' he can compute both g to
the ab' and g to ba'. Yeah it's

195
00:14:38,903 --> 00:14:44,215
不难看出中间人同时知道两个值。因此
not difficult to see the man in the middle
knows both values. And as a result, now he

196
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:49,526
现在他可以扮演中间人，当Alice发送一个加密的信息
can basically play this man in the middle
and when Alice sends an encrypted message

197
00:14:49,526 --> 00:14:54,711
给Bob，中间人可以轻松解密这个信息
to Bob the man in the middle can simply
decrypt this message because he knows the

198
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:59,622
因为他知道Alice加密信息的密钥。然后中间人
重新使用Bob的密钥加密这个信息
secret key that Alice encrypted message
with, re-encrypt it using Bob's key. And

199
00:14:59,622 --> 00:15:04,105
然后把信息发送给Bob。这样Alice发送信息给Bob
then send the message on over to Bob. And
this way Alice sent the message, Bob

200
00:15:04,105 --> 00:15:08,239
Bob接收信息。Bob认为这个信息是安全的
received the message. Bob thinks the
message is secure. But in fact that

201
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:12,605
但事实上这个信息经过了中间人。中间人解密信息
message went through the man in the
middle. The man in the middle decrypted

202
00:15:12,605 --> 00:15:17,146
然后为Bob重新加密了它。同时他可以完全读到信息内容
it, re-encrypted it for Bob. At the same
time he was able to completely read it,

203
00:15:17,146 --> 00:15:21,746
如果他愿意，他可以修改它，等等。
所以这个协议是完全不安全的
modify it if he wants to, and so on. So,
the protocol becomes completely insecure

204
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:26,531
如果有中间人。所以如我所说，我们必须增强
give an man in the middle. And so as I
said we're gonna have to enhance the

205
00:15:26,531 --> 00:15:30,697
这个协议以抵抗中间人攻击
protocol somehow to defend against men in
the middle but it turns out that it's

206
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:34,915
实际上增强和防御中间人攻击并不是很难
actually not that difficult to enhance and
prevent man in the middle attacks.

207
00:15:34,915 --> 00:15:39,377
我们这两周内还将回来看。最后我想做的是
And we're gonna come back to that and see that
in a week or two. The last think I want to

208
00:15:39,377 --> 00:15:43,658
为大家展示一个有趣的Diffie-Hellman协议的性质
do is show you an interesting property of
the Diffie-Hellman protocol. In fact, I

209
00:15:43,658 --> 00:15:48,046
事实上我想给大家展示，这个协议可以被视为
一个非互动的协议
want to show you that this protocol can be
viewed as a non-interactive protocol. So,

210
00:15:48,046 --> 00:15:52,487
我这话什么意思？设想我们有一组用户
what do I mean by that? So Imagine we have
a whole bunch of users, you know, millions

211
00:15:52,487 --> 00:15:56,340
几百万用户。我们叫他们Alice, Bob, Charlie, David等等
of users. Let's call them Alice, Bob,
Charlie, David and so on and so forth.

212
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,567
他们中每个都将选取一个随机的私密值
Each one of them is going to choose a
random, secret value, and then on their

213
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:04,419
然后在他们的Facebook页面上，写下他们
Facebook profiles, they're gonna write
down, their contribution to the

214
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:08,486
对Diffie-Hellman协议的贡献。那么每个人写下了
Diffie-Hellman protocol. Alright so
everybody just writes down you know g to

215
00:16:08,486 --> 00:16:13,604
g^a, g^b, g^c...现在，有趣的是
the a, g to the b, g to the c and so on.
Now the interesting thing about this is,

216
00:16:13,604 --> 00:16:18,942
如果Alice和Charlie想建立一个共享密钥，他们无需相互通信
if say Alice and Charlie wanna set up a
shared key they don't need to communicate

217
00:16:18,942 --> 00:16:24,360
Alice只要去Charlie的公共页面
at all. Basically Alice would go and read
Charlie's public profile. Charlie would go

218
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,635
Charlie只要去Alice的公共页面。刹那间，
他们就共享了一个密钥
and read Alice's public profile. And now,
boom, they immediately have a secret key.

219
00:16:29,635 --> 00:16:34,976
Alice知道了g^ca。Charlie知道了g^ac
Namely, now, Alice knows, g to the c and
a. Charlie knows g to the a and с. And as

220
00:16:34,976 --> 00:16:39,987
因此双方都能计算g^ac。某种意义上
a result, both of them can compute g to
the ac. So, in some sense, once they've

221
00:16:39,987 --> 00:16:44,669
一旦他们在公共页面发布了他们对Diffie-Hellman协议的共享
posted their contributions to the
Diffie-Hellman protocol to their public

222
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:50,076
他们就根本不需要互相通信，就能建立共享密钥
profiles, they don't need to communicate
with each other at all to set up a shared key.

223
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:53,919
他们立即就能有一个共享密钥，现在他们
They immediately have a shared key
and now they can start communicating

224
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:58,194
就通过Facebook来安全地通信了，而不会是和别人
securely through Facebook or not with one
another. And notice that this is true for

225
00:16:58,194 --> 00:17:02,121
注意这对所有Facebook用户都可以。只要我
去读某人的公共页面
any Facebook user. So as soon as I read
somebody's public profile, I immediately

226
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:06,198
我就能迅速得到一个共享密钥，无需互相通信
have a shared key with them without ever
communicating with them. This property is

227
00:17:06,198 --> 00:17:09,967
这个性质有时叫做Diffie-Hellman的非互动性
sometimes called a non-interactive
property of the Diffie-Hellman. So now, let

228
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:14,716
让我给大家展示一个开放问题。这是一个开放问题
me show you an open problem. And this is
an open problem that's been open for ages

229
00:17:14,716 --> 00:17:19,407
各个时代皆如此。如果大家有人能解决它，将是很好的
and ages and ages. So it'd be really cool
if one of you can actually solve it. The

230
00:17:19,407 --> 00:17:24,041
问题是，我们能否对多于两方的用户做这些呢？换句话说
question is, can we do this for more than
two parties? In other words, say we have

231
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:28,559
比如说我们有四方。所有人都在他们的Facebook
公共页面上发布了他们的值
four parties. All of them post their
values to their Facebook profiles. And now

232
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,366
现在我们想只通过阅读Facebook页面
we'd like to make it that just by reading
Facebook profiles, all of them can set up

233
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:38,057
所有人都可以建立共享密钥。换句话说
a shared secret key. In other words, Alice
is, what she'll, she'll do is she'll only

234
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:42,427
Alice会去读其他三个朋友
Bob, Charlie和David的公共页面
read the public profiles of, the three
friends, Bob, Charlie and David. And

235
00:17:42,427 --> 00:17:47,650
她已经可以计算和他们之间的共享密钥。
类似地，David只需
already she can compute a shared key with
them. And similarly David is just gonna

236
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:54,187
读Charlie的公共页面。Bob和Alice
read the public profile of Charlie. Bob
and Alice. And already he has a shared key

237
00:17:54,187 --> 00:17:58,716
他就有了他们4个的共享密钥。问题是，
我们是否可以非互动地建立
with all four of them. Okay, so the
question is whether we can kind of setup

238
00:17:58,885 --> 00:18:03,546
这些共享密钥，对多于两个人的组来说
non-interactively these, these shared keys
for groups that are larger than just two

239
00:18:03,546 --> 00:18:07,986
如我所说，n=2就是Diffie-Hellman协议
people. So as I said, for n equals two,
this is just a Diffie-Hellman protocol. In

240
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:12,594
换句话说，如果只有双方想建立共享密钥
other words, if just two parties want to
set up a shared key without communicating

241
00:18:12,594 --> 00:18:16,696
且无需相互通信，那么使用Diffie-Hellman即可
with one another, that's just
Diffie-Hellman. It turns out, for N equals

242
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:21,473
实际上对N=3的情况，我们也知道怎么做，
有一个已知的协议
three, we also know how to do it, there's
a known protocol, it's called protocol due

243
00:18:21,473 --> 00:18:25,688
是由Joux提出的，它使用了非常高级的数学
to Joux. It already uses very, very fancy
mathematics, much more complicated
(Weil配对：e(B,C)^a=e(A,C)^b=e(A,B)^c=e(P,P)^abc)

244
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:29,959
比我刚刚为大家展示的要复杂得多的数学。
对于N=4或5或任何更大的数
mathematics than what I just showed you.
And for N equals four, or five, or

245
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:34,455
大于4的，这个问题是完全开放的
anything above this, above four, this
problem is completely open. Nearly the

246
00:18:34,455 --> 00:18:38,790
这个情况下，4人在他们的公共页面上发布信息
case where four people post something to
the public profiles and then everybody

247
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:42,908
这样其他人读这些公共页面，然后他们
就有了一个公有的共享密钥
else reads the public profile and then
they have a joint shared key, this is

248
00:18:42,908 --> 00:18:47,459
即使只有4人，我们也不知道怎么做
something we don't know how to do even for
four people. And this is a problem that's

249
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:52,010
这在各个时代都是一个开放的问题，是个有趣的问题
been open for ages and ages, it's kind of
a fun problem to think about and so see if

250
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:56,073
值得想一想，如果你能解决它，就会立即在密码学界有名气
you can solve it, if you will, it's
instant fame in the crypto world. Okay, so

251
00:18:56,073 --> 00:19:00,516
我先说这么多，下节我们会继续讲另一个密钥交换机制
I'll stop here, and we'll continue with
another key exchange mechanism in the next segment.
